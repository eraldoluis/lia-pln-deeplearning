    Convolutional layer of embedding features.
    
    The input of this layer is a 4-D tensor whose shape is:
        (numExs, szWrdWin, numMaxCh, szChWin)
    where
        numExs is the number of examples in a training (mini) batch,
        szWrdWin is the size of the word window
            (the convolution is independently performed for each index in this dimension),
        numMaxCh is the number of characters used to represent words
            (the convolution is performed over this dimension),
        szChWin is the size of the character window
            (each input for the convolution filters is composed by this number of features).
    
    The value numMaxCh, the number of characters used to represent a word,
    is fixed for all word to speedup training. For words that are shorter
    than this value, we extend them with an artificial character. For words
    that are longer than this value, we use only the last numMaxCh
    characters in them.
    
    Thus, this layer is not really convolutional (with variable-sized inputs),
    but it is sufficient for many applications and is much faster than an
    ordinary convolutional layer.

# NLP Deep Learning Framework using Theano

Designed by: Eraldo R. Fernandes

This reposity includes a Deep Learning Framework for Natural Language Processing problems using Theano.

## Features

* Automatic metric logging
* Training loop with callbacks (using observer design pattern)
* Early stopping
* Two SGD-based algorithms: vanilla SGD and AdaGrad

If you want to have a better idea of the most important features,
  you can have a look at the entry point for
    [document classification](https://github.com/eraldoluis/lia-pln-deeplearning/blob/master/experiments/doc_classification/wnn.py)
    and [NER](https://github.com/eraldoluis/lia-pln-deeplearning/blob/master/experiments/ner/wnn.py).
